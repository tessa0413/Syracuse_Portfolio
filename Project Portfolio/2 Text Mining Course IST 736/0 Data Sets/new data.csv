What might surprise many borrowers: Falling behind on repaying those loans can land them in court — and even behind bars.  The issue stems from a clause in the payday loan contracts, as well as quirks in the U.S. legal system. More than 99% of storefront payday lenders have what's called a small-claims ""carve out"" in their contracts, which means that rather than turning to arbitration in case of an unpaid debt, they can take the case to small-claims court.  If the borrower fails to show up for court, they can be arrested for contempt of court. And that's exactly what is happening, with payday lenders increasingly relying on this strategy, according to a new study from the Consumer Federation of America (CFA).

Many reforms have been instituted in the decades since then, but racial bias in LA law enforcement continues to raise concerns. A 2019 report found that the LAPD pulled over black drivers four times as often as white drivers, and Latino drivers three times as often as whites, despite white drivers being more likely to have weapons, drugs or other contraband.  New technological tools employed by the department could be aggravating the problem. In an effort to further reduce crime, the LAPD has turned to big data.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling-2-0-cbsn-originals-documentary/,2/20/2020

The Hill,"Leo Hindery, Jr. and Rick Sloan",We must reject Trump's coup on the American dream,"In June 2015, from a podium inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, Donald Trump kicked off his presidential campaign by declaring the American dream dead. It was more xenophobia-tinged fearmongering from a man who had spent the previous years questioning President Obama’s place of birth. But he was dead wrong: Obama had rescued the country from the grips of economic upheaval and put America back on course for sustainable growth.  Invoking the ideal of the American dream as a political ploy is not new. But weaponizing it to convince Americans that the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness can only be revived by a single man is unprecedented in our country.  That is what Trump did in declaring his candidacy for president, and that is exactly what he has done throughout his first term. He has doubled down on the deeply cynical lie that America’s greatness is contingent upon his grip on power — that the institutions meant to protect our liberty and prosperity are disposable.

In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities. They get paid exactly the same as men. And in my City Hall, the top person, my deputy mayor, was a woman, and 40% of our commissioners were women.” But Bloomberg’s assertion that men and women are paid equally at his company, the financial software giant Bloomberg LP, is false.

The Verge,Natt Garun,Flywheel owners found out that their bikes were bricked through Peloton,"Every morning at 4:30AM, Shani Maxwell would throw on her Flywheel T-shirt and hop on her Fly Anywhere bike. An avid fan who’s been riding with Flywheel since 2013, she’d leapt at the chance to own the company’s branded bike when the company released its Peloton competitor in 2017.  “I was doing five classes a week,” Maxwell says. “With the bike, I started my day riding, then doubled up with a [strength training class] in the afternoon.” On the weekends, she also goes into the studio for a live class with friends who she met from the Flywheel studios in Miami. “It was truly a community. So it came as a surprise when she received an email from Peloton, not Flywheel, informing her that her $1,999 bike would no longer function by the end of next month. Flywheel settled a patent dispute with Peloton earlier in February and decided after the lawsuit to discontinue the at-home bike product.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145349/flywheel-bike-shut-down-email-user-reactions-peloton-trade-in,2/20/2020
The Verge,Adi Robertson,Five lessons from the Justice Department’s big debate over Section 230,"Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is widely criticized, widely praised, and widely misunderstood. The policy allows basically every major website — from YouTube to Wikipedia — to exist in its current form. Depending on who you ask, this is either a wonderful development or a complete disaster. That’s made Section 230 a fixture of recent internet policy debates, particularly at the US Department of Justice, where there is a growing interest in changing the law.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144223/justice-department-section-230-debate-liability-doj,2/20/2020
The Verge,Makena Kelly,"Bloomberg debate video would violate Twitter’s deepfake policy, but not Facebook’s.  What's a joke and what's manipulation","As platforms prepare for the upcoming 2020 election season, Twitter and Facebook are divided on whether a video posted by the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign would violate their policies on manipulated media.   On Thursday, Bloomberg’s 2020 presidential campaign posted a video to Twitter that was edited to make it appear as though there was a long, embarrassing silence from Bloomberg’s Democratic opponents after he mentioned that he was the only candidate to have ever started a business during Wednesday night’s debate. Candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg are shown searching for the words to respond to Bloomberg’s challenge.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21146227/facebook-twitter-bloomberg-debate-video-manipulated-deepfake,2/20/2020
The Verge,Russell Brandom,"Russia is meddling in 2020 campaign to help Trump, intelligence officials say","Russia is already interfering in the 2020 campaign to help President Donald Trump toward reelection, according to a briefing given to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee last week. The briefing, as reported in paired articles from The Washington Post and The New York Times, suggests many of the same tactics used in 2016 could be employed in the months to come, including troll campaigns and targeted hacking attempts.  The day after the briefing was given, President Trump abruptly replaced his acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in what the Post describes as a direct response to the briefing. The Post is less clear on the contents of the briefing, but the Times reports from five different sources that the briefing primarily concerned active Russian threats to election security.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21146191/russia-election-meddling-2020-hack-trump-intelligence,2/20/2020
The Verge,Elizabeth Lopatto ,Susan Fowler blew the whistle on sexism at Uber — and hasn’t written a line of code since,"Susan Fowler wrote her last real line of code at Uber. It’s not that she hasn’t tried since she left the company in 2016; there was a Coursera course she’d tried to take, just to learn something new. It’s just that she got so anxious she couldn’t even finish a simple program.  Do you miss it? Coding?  “I don’t miss it because I associate it with so many of my negative experiences,” Fowler says. She read Gretchen Carlson’s book, Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back, and one thing stuck out to her: women who speak up about harassment in a profession never work in that profession again.  In her case, it’s also true. Fowler is no longer a software engineer.

The Verge,Jay Peters,Facebook will now pay you for your voice recordings But it won’t pay much,"Facebook will offer to pay some users for voice recordings that will be used to help improve its speech recognition technology, the company announced Thursday. The move comes after Facebook — as well as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft — was caught listening to and transcribing voice recordings to improve speech recognition systems without informing customers it was doing so. Facebook will let you make voice recordings as part of a new program called “Pronunciations” in its Viewpoints market research app. If you qualify to be part of the program, Facebook says you’ll be able to record the phrase “Hey Portal” followed by the first name of a friend from your friends list. You’ll be able to do this with the names of up to 10 friends, and you have to record each statement twice. Facebook won’t be paying much for your recordings, though. If you complete one set of recordings, you get 200 points in the Viewpoints app — and you can’t cash out in the Viewpoints app until you earn at least 1,000 points. That only translates to a $5 reward via PayPal. However, Facebook says users may be offered the opportunity to make up to five sets of recordings, so there is the potential to meet that 1,000-point goal and get paid.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145584/facebook-pay-record-voice-speech-recognition-viewpoints-proununciations-app,2/20/2020
The Verge,Nicole Wetsman,"Some African countries at risk for the new coronavirus aren’t prepared Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa are most likely to import the virus, a new model shows","A handful of countries in Africa are at a high risk of importing the new coronavirus because of the volume of air traffic between those countries and China, a new model shows. But some aren’t well-prepared to deal with infections if they arrive.  Right now, Africa only has one confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, after a person in Egypt tested positive for the virus last week. But global public health experts have been concerned about the potential for a wider spread in African countries.  “Our greatest concern is about the potential for spread in countries with weaker health systems,” Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a press conference at the start of February. If the virus arrives in a country already strained by other diseases — for example, Congo, which is still fighting an Ebola outbreak — it will be even harder to control.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145378/coronavirus-africa-egypt-algeria-nigeria-travel-vulnerability,2/20/2020
The Verge,Justine Calma,How Elizabeth Warren answered a hard question about lithium-ion batteries Nevada holds the largest lithium reserve in the US,"The controversial sourcing of lithium-ion batteries briefly took center stage at the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday night in a question directed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).   “The tension here in this state is between people who want renewable energy and people who want conservation on public lands,” said moderator Jon Ralston. He pointed out that Warren had pledged to sign an executive order to stop drilling on public lands on her first day in office. “You’ve got to have lithium, you’ve got to have copper for renewable energy. How do you do that?” he asked Warren.  Nevada has a huge reserve of lithium on public land Switching to electric-powered vehicles and solar energy will be a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the US weaning itself off planet-heating fossil fuels. That technology requires lithium-ion batteries, and Nevada has a huge reserve of lithium on public land.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145418/elizabeth-warren-lithium-ion-batteries-democratic-debate-nevada-thacker-pass,2/20/2020

The company emailed developers today about the change to its widely used Cloud Vision API tool, which uses AI to analyze images and identify faces, landmarks, explicit content, and other recognizable features. Instead of using “man” or “woman” to identify images, Google will tag such images with labels like “person,” as part of its larger effort to avoid instilling AI algorithms with human bias. “a person’s gender cannot be inferred by appearance” In the email to developers announcing the change, Google cited its own AI guidelines, Business Insider reports. “Given that a person’s gender cannot be inferred by appearance, we have decided to remove these labels in order to align with the Artificial Intelligence Principles at Google, specifically Principle #2: Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.” ",https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145356/google-ai-images-gender-bias-labels-people,2/20/2020
